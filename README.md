# Extending the Prompting Modalities of STEVE-1-based Generative Agents

## Installation
We recomend using python 3.10 when running this code.
1. Follow the instructions to install the [STEVE-1 agent](https://github.com/Shalev-Lifshitz/STEVE-1)
2. Download this repository and place it in the same directory as the STEVE-1 installation: `git clone https://github.com/nlenzen/steve_multimodal`
   The directory structure should look like this:
   ```
    parent_dir
    ├── STEVE-1
    └── steve_multimodal

   ```
4. Change into the steve_multimodal directory: `cd steve_multimodal`
5. Run `pip install requirements.txt`
6. All done!
